### INTRODUCTION

This project's aim is to create a collection of finance related code for personal use and as a training for myself, nothing contained in this work represent's any form of financial advice. What I would like to accomplish with this project is to familiarise myself with Python and a different set of libraries, for now the project can be divided in three main parts (everything is still a WIP):

### ðŸ“Š  [Finance Functions](#finance-functions)
### ðŸ“ˆ  [Basic Stock Chart and Analysis](#basic-stock-chart-and-analysis)
### ðŸ’¯  [Finding an Efficient Portfolio](#finding-an-efficient-portfolio)
### ðŸ”®  [Online Dashboard Hosted on Heroku](#online-dashboard-hosted-on-heroku)





## Finance Functions
- [Finance Functions](https://github.com/giorgio-sirtori/Finance/blob/main/finance.ipynb): This is a set of function used through the repository and with the purpose of creating a sort of personal library, the main tools used are pandas and yfinance to obtain stock prices.
## basic-stock-chart-and-analysis
- [Basic Stock Charts and Analysis](https://github.com/giorgio-sirtori/Finance/blob/main/basic_stock_charts.ipynb): Some simple charts and a monte carlo simulation of a stock price.
## Finding an Efficient Portfolio
- [Finding an Efficient Portfolio](https://github.com/giorgio-sirtori/Finance/blob/main/portfolio_efficient_frontier.ipynb): Given a stock portfolio, find the optimal weights using a Monte Carlo Simulation.
## Online Dashboard Hosted on Heroku
- [TBD](): Work in progress.
