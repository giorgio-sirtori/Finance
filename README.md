The aim of this repository is to create a personal collection of code related to the finance world

This nobeook contains functions that I wrote to make my life easier. I am not a code expert so this has helped me to better understand how to move around with my personal code and how to use again snippets of code that are useful.

To Do List
========================
Finish the implementation of basics functions that might be needed to perform financial data manipulation.
Create some visualisations.
Create an online Dashboard using Heroku and Plotly to do some visualization.
