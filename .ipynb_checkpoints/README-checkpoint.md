### INTRODUCTION

This project's aim is to create a collection of finance related code for personal use and as a training for myself, nothing contained in this work represent's any form of financial advice. What I would like to accomplish with this project is to familiarise myself with Python and a different set of libraries, for now the project can be divided in three main parts (everything is still a WIP):
